Bacon and gruyere tater tot casserole:

* 12 oz frozen tater tots (or however many will fit across the top of your baking sheet - it was about 13 oz for mine)
* 6 pieces bacon, or about half of a standard pack (more if you like more bacon)
* 1 shallot, grated or diced
* 1 1/4 cups gruyere, grated
* 6 eggs
* 1 cup egg whites
* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt 
* Pinch of salt
* 1 tbsp garlic powder (or to taste)

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9x13" baking dish.

Fry your bacon over medium heat. Work in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Put aside the bacon to drain on a plate, then fry your shallot in the bacon drippings until sufficiently soft. Remove when cooked, then discard the drippings. (Note: feel free to add any other veggies or addendums of choice to saute alongside the shallot!)

Crumble the bacon into the bottom of the greased bacon dish. Scatter the sauteed shallot along the bottom of the dish.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites, salt, garlic powder, and Greek yogurt, making sure to smooth any clumps. Add 1 cup of the gruyere and mix well.

Pour the egg, cheese, and yogurt mixture over the bacon and shallots. 

Assemble tater tots evenly over the top of the dish, covering the surface. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup (or however much you desire!) gruyere over the top of the casserole.

Bake at 350F for 35-40 minutes, or until egg mixture is set.
