# Gochujang gnocchi

## Ingredients
* 120g gnocchi
* 1 tbsp butt
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1 oz parmesian
* 2 oz mozzerella cheese
* salt/pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. In a pan over medium low heat, melt the butter.
2. Once the butter has melted, toss in the gnocchi and cook until they're lightly golden. Constantly move them around in the pan so that they donâ€™t burn.
3. After the gnocchi are lightly golden, add in the minced garlic and saute until fragrant (~1-2 mins).
4. Add in the gochujang and quickly toss the gnocchi in the gochujang (~1 min).
5. Lower the heat and add in the heavy cream.
6. Toss the gnocchi into the heavy cream until the sauce becomes red from the gochujang (~2-3 mins).
7. Add in the cheeses and mix until they melt into the sauce (~3-4 mins).
8. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
9. Serve and enjoy! This is best served immediately! Top with more parmesan cheese and black pepper as desired.
