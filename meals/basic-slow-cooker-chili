* 2 pounds ground turkey (900g)
* 1 large onion chopped
* 1 green bell pepper diced
* 4 garlic cloves minced
* 3 (15.5-ounce/439g) cans kidney beans
* 2 (14.5-ounce/400g) cans diced tomatoes undrained
* 1 (28-ounce/794g) can tomato sauce
* ½ cup beef broth (120mL)
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic until beef is browned, about 6 minutes. (Drain the beef mixture if your meat is very greasy.).
2. Transfer the browned beef mixture to a 6-quart slow cooker, and add the beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, broth, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well.
3. Cover and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours. (You can stir it occasionally during cooking, but you don’t need to!) 
4. Serve topped with sour cream, cheese, and green onions or any desired toppings. 

The chili can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.
