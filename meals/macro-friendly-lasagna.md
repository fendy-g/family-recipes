# Ingredients
## Sauce
- Ground meat of choice (I used turkey) - ~2 lb
- Garlic - 6 grated or sliced (follow your heart)
- Yellow onion - 1 large
- Tomato paste - 6 oz can
- Crushed tomatos - 28 oz
- Veges of choice in whatever your heart desires (I used some from a bag of frozen stir fried veges)
- Fenel seed powder - 2 teaspoons

## Cheese aspects
- Flour - 63 g (1/2 cup)
- Milk - 4 cups
- Butter - 113 g (1 stick)
- Nutmeg - freshly grated
- White pepper
- Salt - 3/4 teaspoons
- Parmesan - 4 oz
- Low fat mozarella cheese - 8oz

## Instructions
### Make the sauce
1. Heat up large pot (dutch oven or anything larger than 5 QTs) and add oil
2. Throw meat in and cook until browned. Move meat to a separate bowl afterwards
3. Add a bit more oil and add garlic, cooking for roughly 30 seconds or until fragrant
4. Add onions, cook until transluscent
5. Add vegetables, stir fried until cooked
6. Add seasonings (fennel seed powder, maybe chili flakes, salt and pepper, etc).
7. Add tomato paste, cook until caramelized or starts sticking to bottom of pan
8. Add crushed tomatoes, stir and mix. At this point, you can optionally use an immersion blender or add to a blender and puree it (add some water if you need to).
9. Add meat back, simmer the heck out of it until thick enough for you.

### Make bechemel
1. Throw butter in sauce pan (large enough to add milk and have some room) and melt completely
2. Add flour and mix until a paste (congrats you've made a roux!)
3. Slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) add milk, whisking constanly and making sure it gets incorporated until you add more. It may feel like it ends up as a paste, but power through and pray that your whisking arm is strong enough.
4. Once all the milk is added, keep cooking for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened.
5. Remove contents to a separate container and let it come to room temperature. Cover with a plastic wrap over the surface to prevent a skin from forming (or just take the formed skin off after the fact)

### Lasagna time
1. Preheat oven to 375 F (I dunno what that is in C, sorry)
2. In a large pot of salted boiling water, add in your lasagna sheets. Cook until 1 minute short of box instructions, then remove from pot (skip if using oven bought lasagna, I guess)
3. While cooking pasta or after, shred your cheese.
4. LAYERS. Add meat sauce to bottom. Then add lasagna, meat sauce, bechemel sauce, then cheese. Repeat until you hit gold (aka the top of the pan)
5. Cover pan, throw in oven, cook for roughly 25 minutes. Uncover, cook for another 30 minutes.
6. Take out, let cool for 30 minutes, and enjoy.
