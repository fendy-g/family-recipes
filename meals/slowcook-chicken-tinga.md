### Ingredients

* ~2 lbs skinless chicken thigh (consider bone-in!)
* 2-5 canned chipotle peppers
* 1-14.5-ounce can of fire-roasted tomatoes
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 chopped onion
* 3 tsp kosher salt
* black pepper
* 1 tsp cumin 
* 1 tsp Mexican oregano
* Optinal extras:
  * chili powder
  * a whole bay leaf
  * smoked paprika

### Instructions
1. Put everything in slow cooker - 6 hours on low or 3 hours on high
2. Once done, take chicken out. Shred it via preferred method (I use the let it cool and then use my hands with gloves to tear it apart)
3. Put slow cooker to high if not already. Immersion blend the sauce (or you blend it before cooking)
4. Once blended, put chicken back in, stir it up, and cook for another 15 minutes (long enough to thicken sauce and coat the met)
5. Serve in whatever you want.
