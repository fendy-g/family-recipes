# Chef Jon's enchilada sauce:

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup diced onion
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
* 3 to 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, depending on how thick you like it
* 2 tablespoons ground chili powder, like ancho
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon chipotle
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* cayenne to taste
* small pinch cinnamon
* 3 cloves minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 1/2 cups chicken broth (COLD if you can help it)

1. Toss olive oil and butter in pot/skillet/saucier over medium heat. You can just use either oil or butter if you don't wanna add em both.
2. When melted, add onions and generous pinch of salt. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the smallest pieces of onion start to turn golden brown.
3. Roux time - toss in the flour, chili powder, cumin, chipotle pepper, black pepper, oregano, cayene, and cinnamon. Stir and cook for 3-4 minutes
4. Toss in the garlic and tomato paste and cookie for a few minutes. It may clump, but keep pressing on.
5. Add in chicken broth and whisk, then turn heat up to high. When it bubbles, reduce to med-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Adjust seasoning as needed. Immersion blend the sauce.
