Banana (Nut) Bread

* 5 very ripe bananas
* 3/4 cup vegetable shortening (butter can also work for this, but I've never tried it with this recipe)
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 eggs
* 1.5 cups nuts, chopped (feel free to omit, if desired - I use pecans, but black walnuts will also do nicely)
* 1.5 tsp baking soda
* 3 cups self-rising flour 

Preheat the oven to 250F. Grease and flour a bundt pan. Incorporate the flour and baking soda in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Beat bananas well in a large mixing bowl. Add all other ingredients except the flour, soda and nuts (if using) - mix well with a hand or stand mixer. Incorporate the flour + soda blend gradually, mixing thoroughly, until all of the blend has been added. Fold the nuts in last, if using. Place a quart-sized, oven-safe container filled with water in the bottom of the oven. Place bread in the middle of the middle-most rack; bake for 1 hour.*

\* **Note**: May take 1.5 hours or slightly more in some ovens. This takes about 1h 40min in my new gas oven.
