# Lemon Olive Oil Cake

### Cake
- finely grated zest of 3 large lemons
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, preferably mild flavored
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 2/3 cup all purpose flour (see note)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2/3 cup whole or 2% milk

### Lemon glaze
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice

## Instructions
### Cake:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F with a rack in the center of the oven. Line the bottom of a 9-inch round pan with parchment paper. Grease the pan and set aside. Note: the cake pan should be at least 2-inches high.
2. In a large bowl, whisk lemon zest and sugar until combined. Add eggs, oil, lemon juice, and vanilla whisking until well combined.
3. In a separate bowl combine, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add half the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking until just combined. Whisk in the milk followed by the remaining dry ingredients, being careful to to overmix.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove air bubbles. Allow the cake batter to sit for another minute or two and then tap on the counter again to remove air bubbles.
5. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. It is important not to open the oven during bake time or to move the cake around before it is set (this can cause it to sink in the middle). Remove the cake from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack to cool completely.

### Lemon glaze (recipe can be halved for a thinner layer of icing):
1. Whisk ingredients until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more lemon juice to thin or more powdered sugar to thicken.
2. Once the cake has cooled remove it from the pan and add the glaze. I pour it over the top and spread it across the top and down the sides. Allow the glaze to firm up a bit before slicing and serving.

\* **Flour**: Whisk the flour to fluff and lighten it. Lightly scoop a heaping portion and level it off with the back of a knife. \
\** **Serving and Storage**: Serve cake at room temperature for the best texture. Serve as-is or top each slice with lightly sweetened whipped cream and/or fresh berries. Store refrigerated or at room temperature. Cake stays fresh for several days.
