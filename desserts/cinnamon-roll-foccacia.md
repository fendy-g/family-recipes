## Instructions

### Day 1 (evening)
1. Combine all ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a spatulate until incorporated. This mixture is called the poolish.
2. Cover the bowl with a towel or seran wrap and leave on counter until the following morning.

### Day 2 (morning)
1. Take water and pour around the edges of the poolish to help loosen it from the bowl.
2. In a separate mixing bowl (the one that would attach to the stand mixer, or just a larger mixing bowl), add the flour, salt, and the poolish from the previous night.
3. Mix together with a spoon until slightly combined, then finish the rest with a dough hook. Once fully mixed, cover with a towel.
4. 30 minutes later, do a tuck and fold, then re-cover the bowl with the towel.
5. 30 more minutes after, do another tuck and fold and cover the bowl once again.

### Day 2 (4-5 hours later, or the evening)
1. Uncover, dough will have risen and developed.
2. If you're breaking up the dough into several batches, follow the next set of steps.
  * Flour counter space and put dough on it. 
  * Cut up dough into number of batches - for reference, the whole batch can fill up a 21" x 15" sheet pan. If smaller pans, then cut up appropriately.
3. Optionally, for deeper flavor, you can continue to let the dough rest in the fridge until you're ready to cook it next day or even the day after. Not required.
4. If you decide to let it rest for longer, you will need to take the dough out of the fridge at least 2 hours before to come back to room temperature.

### Time of cooking (whether it's the same day you were initially making the dough or several days later)
1. Preheat the oven to 450F (only if the dough portions are small, else wait until step 7).
2. We will now start making the cinnamon sugar filling.
3. In a sauce pan, melt the butter.
4. Once butter is melted, add brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Mix until heated through and combined. Turn off heat. Let the mixture cool down 
  * You could put this over an ice bath and mix it to cool it down quicker, or just manually wait.
5. In either a greased/buttered sheet pan or in the bowl with the proofed dough (if it's big enough), you will want to pour the cinnamon sugar mixture onto the dough.
6. From there, tuck and fold to ensure that the cinnamon mixture not only coats the top and bottom, but also has layers of it within the bread.
  * This could potentially be done at the end of the previous section, but I have not tested it personally)
7. Once mixed enough and placed in a greased/buttered pan, cover and allow the dough to proof long enough to fill the pan
  * Time varies based on size. 
8. Once proofed, dimple your dough to add in "pockets" to the bread.
9. Place in oven, cooking from 20-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190-210F.
10. Once done, pull out and let to rest. Meanwhile, make the icing
  * Combine powdered sugar and milk - 1 tablespoon at a time - until you reach the consistency you want. Then add the vanilla extract.
11. Pour icing over bread. 
12. Enjoy
