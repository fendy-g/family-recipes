# Baking instructions

## To get ready before actual baking:
1. Measure out 1/4 cup of buttermilk and one egg and bring to room temperature - takes roughly an hour (butter should be super soft, buttermilk should not feel cold in a glass or metal measuring cup)

## Making the dough:
1. Measure out 1/2 cup of sugar
2. Scoop out 1 tablespoon of the measured sugar and put that in the bowl of a stand mixer
3. Add 2 & 1/4 tsp of yeast and 3/4 cup of warm water to the stand mixer bowl with the sugar
4. Mix until everything is just combined, and leave it alone until the yeast has fully foamed over the entire surface area of the water, about 5-7 mins
5. While yeast is proofing, in another bowl, pour in the canola oil with the room temp buttermilk and egg, and whisk combined
6. Add in remaining sugar to the buttermilk mixture, and stir until everything is mostly combined
7. Add 1 cup of bread flour and 1 cup of AP flour to the mixing bowl straight on top of the liquids along with a teaspoon of super fine salt
8. Put on mixer’s dough hook, and put it on the stir setting, and let that first round of flour get mostly incorporated
9. This is the tricky part. Add AP flour in half cup increments by turning the mixer off, flipping the dough hook up, adding the flour directly in the middle, then scraping down the sides before flipping the dough hook back down, and setting back to stir. 
 - Do this until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, and your fingers come back clean after poking the dough. If you have a smaller mixer, you will have to stop the machine, pull the whole ass dough ball entirely off the hook, flip it upside down, and set it to mix again because the bottom of the dough ball and the top will have different consistencies. 
 - General rule is to never go over 5 cups of flour, but it’s more important that the dough is not sticking to the bowl or your fingers, that’s a sign that it has just enough flour
10. Once dough has reached the right amount of flour, set your mixer to the 1st speed above stir, knead for 3 mins, then set back to stir for 3 mins
11. Take dough out of the bowl, spray bowl with canola cooking spray, put dough back into bowl, and cover with plastic wrap and a clean dish cloth, and set aside to rise for NO MORE THAN 2 HOURS - do not overproof the first proof. The plastic wrap is so you can take the dish cloth off to check it often without disturbing it. Dough should double in size
12. After proofing, roll out the proofed dough into a big square until it’s about half a finger-width tall. Use flour to help it stop from sticking to the counter (this is why we don’t want to over-add flour in the mixing stage, it will pick up some flour here)
13. In a medium mixing bowl, mix packed dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch (helps keep the icing IN the rolls and not just melting out to make a cinnamon sugar cement at the bottom of the tray during baking). 
- If you are getting chunks in your brown sugar, you can use a small strainer or sifter for the next stage
14. Unwrap the butter and cut it as best you can into chunks to spread around on top of the dough. it should be so soft that you can spread it with a cake spreader or fork.  leave a 1 inch section at the longest end of your square un-buttered
- Wouldn’t recommend spreading with a knife since you can knick holes in the dough.
15. Dump out or sift the cinnamon sugar mixture onto the buttered dough. Spread with your hands to get every section covered. 
16. Once it’s mostly even, take your rolling pin and gently roll over the mixture to press it into the butter
17. Roll that bitch up to the un-buttered end, use the lack of butter to press the log shut
18. Score your log every 3 fingers width, and then cut out your rolls from the log to put into a pan LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER!!! 
- PSA: DO NOT GREASE YOUR PAN!!!! the cinnamon sugar will become a cement that sticks to glass and metal, only parchment paper can deal with that bullshit. Please trust me on this, parchment paper is THE key to being able to get the rolls out of the pan without having to pry them out with some kind of sugary crowbar, ask me how I know
19. Cover again with plastic wrap and a clean dish cloth 
- trim the extra parchment paper if it’s making the plastic wrap hard to apply
20. Proof rolls for 2-5 hours - takes longer in winter, shorter in summer, altitude is also a factor. You want your rolls to spread OUT, not up. Your proof is done when rolls are almost touching, like this:
21. When rolls are ready to bake, preheat oven to 350, and bake for 17-21 mins on a middle rack uncovered. WATCH THEM 
- You want them lightly golden brown on the dough tops. Anything more and reheating rolls later in the week will be dry and crumbly

## Icing (make as rolls are baking)
1. Whip the room temp butter and cream cheese together with a whisk attachment for 5 mins. 
- Texture should have visible air bubbles in it, it should be HELLA whipped
2. Add vanilla extract, corn syrup, and lemon juice, and whip until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl while doing so
3. Add a cup of powdered sugar. Whip on high speed for 2 mins.
4. Add another cup of powdered sugar. Whip on high speed for 2 mins
5. Add half a cup of powdered sugar. Whip on medium speed for 5 mins. 
- Icing should have stiff peaks and be visibly airy, and have the light brown of the vanilla extract mostly whipped back to a soft white color
6. When rolls are done, IMMEDIATELY dollop icing onto the center of each roll. spread around the dollops as they melt to cover any exposed dough. 
- You want this icing to melt into the tops of the rolls
7. Eat one immediately (extremely vital step)
8. Wait until rolls have fully cooled to plastic wrap and put in the fridge for storage. 
- If you have to ask yourself how long they stay good in the fridge, then please reconsider your lifestyle as I am not about self control. I save the extra icing to ice the sides of the rolls i take out of the middle of the pan
 
to reheat, put a roll from the fridge onto a flat microwave-safe surface - sometimes i use tupperware tops, do NOT use ceramic plates, they will shatter - microwave on regular settings for 45 secs. i recommend applying fresh icing half way through this so it’s melty but not mostly returned into its butter state
